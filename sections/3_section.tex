\subsection{Early approaches}
Early approaches date all the way back to 2010, with Docker being released in 2013. In 2006 the cost of electricity consumed by IT infrastructures in the US was estimated as 4.5 billion dollars and tends to double by 2011\cite{beloglazov_energy_2010}.
During the first attempts in \cite{beloglazov_energy_2010}, a simple Bin Packing variation with DVFS enabled was chosen to solve this problem. The results, obtained using CloudSim enviroment, showed  gain 83\% compared to no policy with a SLA violation of 1.1\% which represented the beginning of the research on this topic.

\textbf{--EXPAND ON THIS ARGUMENT--
Advancements introduced predictive models like Wiener filters and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). The GPR combined with convex optimization showed ~35\% energy savings with ~15\% latency increase. The Wiener filter, though less suited for non-stationary environments, offered ~33\% savings. [Note Ewan.pdf]

\subsection{Containers Rise}
Containers began replacing VMs for lightweight virtualization. Initial efforts focused on container migration to reduce active VM count. Strategies involved modular watchdogs and Pearson correlation checks. [Notes - Long Version.pdf]

Flow network models enabled scalable concurrent container scheduling with multi-resource awareness and affinity considerations. These models balanced execution speed and resource utilization across up to 5000 machines. [Notes - Long Version.pdf]


Focus shifted to application-layer availability using metrics like MTTF and MTTR. Scheduling considered redundancy, affinity, and anti-affinity rules to ensure SLA compliance during failures. [Notes - Long Version.pdf]
