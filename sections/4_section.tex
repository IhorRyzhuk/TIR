\subsection{Allocation}
\textbf{HERE WE SHOULD HAVE TABLES THAT SHOW THE NUMBERS FOR ALL METHODS USED. WHICH ALGORITHMS OVER THE YEARS, THE COMPLEXITY, PARAMETERS TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT}

\subsection{Evaluation}
\textbf{HERE WE SHOULD HAVE TABLES/descriptions comparing different sizes of the evaluation. Meaning that we should compare the hardware and environment each approach was tested on. IF WE DO THIS WELL, WE HAVE THE RESULTS/CONCLUSION SECTION FOR FREE}
